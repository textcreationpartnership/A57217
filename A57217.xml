            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And now, dear Sir, Having (in part) acquainted you with the reaſon of my intended proceedings, my next care is (what I can) to leſſen your trouble, to which end I think it the beſt way to propound three of each ſort of People, chief amongſt them, as Overſeers of the reſt, men of good report, into whoſe hands the 30 <hi>l.</hi> may be delivered (as a ſign of my Love) and by them be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95304:2"/>diſtributed amongſt thoſe of their way, who are in need, ſickneſs, or any other kind of Adverſity, which is according to the way firſt propounded, as alſo agreeable to a Liſt herein incloſed to you.</p>
            <p>And becauſe you formerly ſeemed to ſcruple the giving of 30 <hi>l.</hi> to the Roman Catholicks, I have therefore written to three of my old Acquaintance, viz. to Mr. <hi>Bacon,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Blackborow,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rawlinſon,</hi> deſiring their eare and pains in the diſpoſing of that money, as alſo of the 30 <hi>l.</hi> given to the Church of the firſt born, according to the Liſt aforeſaid, who will (I doubt no) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſſiſt you in any ſervice of Love, that concerns the Affairs of this buſineſs, whenſoever you ſhall pleaſe to require it of them.</p>
            <p>Finally, When the whole ſum ſhall be (according to my Requeſt) diſpoſed of, my earneſt deſire is, That you will be pleaſed to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto me the names of thoſe Perſons who ſhall undertake to diſtribute the ſum, that ſo I may have the fairer opportunity to bequeath to them thoſe future Pledges and further Teſtimonies of my Love, which I have received from the Spirit of Truth, for to diſtribute unto the ſeveral Tribes and Families of the earth, that all may know his name to be one, <hi>viz.</hi> (Love in Truth) as proceeding out of <hi>Joſephs</hi> Store-houſe, or rather from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that true and faithful Witneſs, who brought into Peace and Reſt the whole Tabernacle of Witneſſes, in all Ages, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Gentilss;</hi> but alſo into Heaven it ſelf, the full number of Sealed Ones, even one hundred and fourty four thouſand, the whole Land of <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> (where he now appears in us, our Song and Crown, our Joy and Glory; <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah</hi>) O. <hi>Emanuel,</hi> fill thou the bredth of thy Land, (even the whole Earth) with thy bleſſed Seed of Love to Enemies; which bruiſeth the head of Enmity, <hi>Hallelujah;</hi> that they may ſtand as Saviours on the Top of Mount <hi>Gerizim</hi> (which by Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is as Mount <hi>Ziou,</hi> the Mountaine of God, Love) there to Judge and Bleſs the Mount of <hi>Eſau, viz.</hi> Gods whole Creation, according to the ſame Pattern or Spirit of loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherewith God hath Judged and Saved us: So will the Kingdoms of this world be made the Lords and his Chriſts, who muſt reign for ever: <hi>Hallelujah</hi> to God on high, on Earth peace and good will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now Sir, if you ſhould complain that I have been tedious and troubleſome in This work, I ſhall eaſily acknowledge both, and alſo humbly beg your pardon; yet withall muſt ſay, that he which Truly believeth, maketh not haſte, but rather chuſeth either to ſtay, or walk, even as the Principle of Faith, (the Grace of God) leadeth (which is ſomething elſe beſides the Letters teaching) and neither willeth nor runneth before that guide, who leedeth into all Truth; neither doth he deſire to awaken his Beloved till him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pleaſeth; to whom the loweſt depth of ſilence (in the will of God) is as welcome as the moſt quickning motions, which mount the Soul in the Chariot of <hi>Aminadab:</hi> For to him who hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned always, continually, and evermore to pray; <hi>(God's will be done)</hi> as well when he forſaketh, crucifieth, or tryeth, as when he makes alive, I ſay who can ſeparate ſuch an one from the Love of God, freely given and planted in the Soul? can a Life that is Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Senſual? or can Death or Fear of Hell? I tell you nay; Love to good, is much more ſtronger than all theſe; doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and caſt them forth: So under the Vine, or Divine Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Experience, reſteth in Peace, as in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, the Soul of</p>

In which Innocent Spirit of Love there is no Spot nor yet Wrinkle, for it thinketh none ill to its Neighbour, and can do none: This is the Seed and Plant which our Heavenly Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone planteth, will bleſs, and whom none can curſe, the which muſt grow and increaſe into a great Tree, ſo that the Fowls of the Aire, may lodge in the Branches thereof, (even All thoſe Cares, Fears, and vain Imaginations which attend the Life of Man) whoſe Leaves are for the healing of the Nations: <hi>Hallelujah</hi> to God in the higheſt, on Earth Peace and Reſt, to men of Good will; the which I moſt humbly offer to the God of the whole Earth; and Lord of the Spirits in all fleſh, as a perpetual, eternal, everlaſting Incenſe-Sacrifice, and Prayers of all Saints, to him who is our King, and hath made us Kings and Prieſts for evermore.
